## What you'll need to get started

* [Install OSGeo4W](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)
  * this will allow us to use combine multiple files covering a larger area into a single mosaic and let the program see it as one file
* Download digital elevation models | [USGS](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/)
  * I used data specially from "Elevation Products.../1-meter DEM" use the "extent" filter feature to quickly search all the LiDAR scans of the selected area (you can also use the show feature to see if these models cover the area you are interested in)
